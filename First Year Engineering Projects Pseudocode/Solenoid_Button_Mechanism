// Solenoid Pseudocode C++ - Eventual Arduino Conversion
// No methods. Only functions and variables.

// pin(x) determines which pin is being activated by low -> high power. When the button is pushed 
// the power will change from low to high and activate the solenoid. When the button determines which pin to power 
// the pins connected to the solenoid will switch between HIGH and LOW with a delay in between of 500 ms. 
// This will put the power towards one positive end of the solenoid to activate the pin on the solenoid, then
// after 500 ms it will switch pin power to push the other pin back. This is for the ball drop mechanism
// and will have individual functionality for each button and have a smooth delay time to drop no more than 
// one ball.
