### Course Description:
The First-Year Engineering Projects course ( GEEN 1400 ) is an interdisciplinary hands-on design/build/test course for entry-level engineering students. 
Through this course, students put engineering theory into practice early in their undergraduate years by working in teams to design, 
build and test new products and inventions.

### Project Description:
The ball drop game is a multidisciplinary project created to assist learning disabled individuals with cause and affect relations. The software developed
was written in the Arduino environment based on C++ libraries and functionality and injected into the Arduino MEGA board. The electronics were created in-house using circuit diagrams and beginner
soldering techniques. The physical product was created using the CAD development environment and then implementing the design via a laser cutter on 
plexiglass.
